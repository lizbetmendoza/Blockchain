# Blockchain
A blockchain originally block chain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data.

### A basic sample for mining 
The result 
```
 Starting the miner...
Block mined:00eac1f2db416d63b033a2475dfe262412b99bd44a9de89aa9e1c6fdada89bd1
Block successfully mined!

 Balance: 0

 Balance of you is, 0

 Starting the miner again...
Block mined:002903b9c0a00f4feb172ba4a9eac553dc2cc9f2b9efca45816161161da18c2d
Block successfully mined!

 Balance: 100

 Balance of you is, 100
